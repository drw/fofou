Twiglet's fork of kjk's original software made the Python version
of fofou compatible with recent changes to Google App Engine.

**This** fork of Twiglet's fork includes my style modifications 
and tweaks.

Original Overview (by kjk)
==========================

For more info: http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/fofou/

Fofou (Forums For You) is a simple forum software inspired by
Joel On Software forum software (http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/?joel).

It's mostly a port of FruitShow PHP forum (http://sourceforge.net/projects/fruitshow).

There are two versions:

* one in Python for Google App Engine (directory appengine). I used this versions
  for a few years but no longer use it and no longer work on it

* second written in Go (directory go), which I currently use at 
  http://forums.fofou.org

Where can I see it in action?
=============================

Forums for my Sumatra PDF reader are powered by Fofou:

Installation.
=============

For Google App Engine version you need to get App Engine
account and upload fofou (see
http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/gettingstarted/uploading.html for
details).

Once installed, you can create one or more forums through web interface.

Go version needs to be compiled and run on a server. I use Linux (Ubuntu).
It is, however, not easy to deploy and I'm too lazy to document deployment
process.

Design philosophy.
==================

You'll quickly see that Fofou differs in many ways from most common forum
software. There are good reasons for the differences and Joel Spolsky describes
those reason in great detail:

License.
========

The python/Go code is written completely by me and is in Public Domain.

Html/css/js files are mostly lifted from FruitShow, so they fall under
FruitShow's BSD license.
